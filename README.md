# Data-Manipulation-with-dplyr
Say you've found a great dataset and would like to learn more about it. How can you start to answer the questions you have about the data? You can use dplyr to answer those questionsâ€”it can also help with basic transformations of your data. You'll also learn to aggregate your data and add, remove, or change the variables. Along the way, you'll explore a dataset containing information about counties in the United States. You'll finish the course by applying these tools to the babynames dataset to explore trends of baby names in the United States.
